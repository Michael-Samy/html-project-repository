<h2>1-The importance of artificial intelligence in medical field:</h2>
<h3>The field of health care is developing at an increasing speed, with a significant increase in the amount of data and challenges in terms of cost and patient outcomes; Therefore, artificial intelligence applications have been used to reduce these challenges, and the following are the most important examples of the role of artificial intelligence (AI) in this field:</h3>

<ol type="a">
  <li><b>Forecasting transfers Intensive Care Unit:</b>Unplanned transfer of patients to the intensive care unit can lead to poor outcomes, and sometimes even death. Therefore, artificial intelligence has been used to reduce the proportion of these cases, by finding patients with serious cases, as artificial intelligence systems use patients’ medical records, laboratory results, and their vital signs to correct the patients’ condition before it deteriorates, and having to transfer them to the intensive care unit, and it can guide Artificial intelligence systems doctors to the point of initiation of treatment.</li>
  <li><b>Medical examination:</b>Unnecessary routine laboratory testing increases undue financial costs; Therefore, artificial intelligence applications have been used to narrow the circle of laboratory tests that the patient may need. Improving Clinical Workflow. Predicting Hospital Acquired Infections.</li>
</ol>
<h2>2-The importance of artificial intelligence in business:</h2>
<p>Artificial intelligence helps enhance business capabilities in all areas, and gives companies the ability to demonstrate all their capabilities and raise them to the highest levels. It increases the efficiency of business and the speed of its implementation, increases its value, contributes to the continuous development of business, and increases the number of interacting with these businesses, due to the continuous development of tools and software related to it.</p>
<h2>3-The importance of artificial intelligence in daily life</h2>
<h3>Here are some examples of the importance of using artificial intelligence applications in daily life:</h3>

<ol type="a">
  <li>The use of artificial intelligence applications has revolutionized the automotive industry. For example, Google's self-driving program uses artificial intelligence techniques, as do logistics companies such as Uber; To reduce accidents and reduce traffic congestion.</li>
  <li>Artificial intelligence applications are used in e-commerce websites ; Like Amazon, to get a clear picture of customers' behavior in purchases on the site, and to make recommendations.</li>
  <li>Social networks use artificial intelligence applications, such as Facebook AI, to detect the presence of a breach of user photos.</li>
