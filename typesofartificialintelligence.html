  <h2><u>types of artificial inteligence :</u></h2>
  
<h3>Artificial intelligence can be classified according to its capabilities into three different types as follows:</h3>
<ol type="1">
  <li><b>limited or Narrow Artificial Intelligence:</b> Weak AI or Narrow AI is one of the types of artificial intelligence that can perform specific and clear tasks, such as self-driving cars, or even speech or image recognition programs, or chess on the Smart devices , and this type of artificial intelligence is the most common and available type today.</li>
  <li><b>General Artificial Intelligence:</b>which is the type that can work with a capacity similar to the human ability in terms of thinking, as it focuses on making the machine capable of thinking and planning on its own and similar to human thinking, but there are no practical examples of This type, all that there is so far are just research studies that need a lot of effort to develop and turn them into reality, and the Artificial Neural Network method (in English: Artificial Neural Network) is one of the methods of studying general artificial intelligence, as it is concerned with producing a system of neural networks for a machine similar to the one it contains. the human body.</li>
  <li><b>Super artificial intelligence:</b>is considered the type that may exceed the level of human intelligence , and which can perform tasks better than a specialized and knowledgeable person, and this type has many characteristics that it must include; Such as the ability to learn, plan, communicate automatically, and make judgments, but the concept of AI is considered a hypothetical concept that does not exist in our time. </li>
</ol>
<h3>Artificial intelligence can also be classified according to the functions it performs, as this classification includes four different types as follows:</h3>
<ol type="1">
  <li><b>Reactive machines:</b>The artificial intelligence of interactive machines is the simplest type of artificial intelligence; As this type lacks the ability to learn from past experiences or past experiences to develop future business, it interacts with current experiences to get them out in the best possible way.</li>
  <li><b>Limited memory:</b>The type of artificial intelligence with limited memory (in English: Limited Memory) can store data from previous experiences for a limited period of time, and the self-driving system is one of the best examples of this type; It stores the last speed of other cars, how far the car is from other cars, the speed limit, and other data needed for road driving.</li>
  <li><b>Theory of Mind:</b>this type of artificial intelligence is concerned with the machine's understanding of human feelings, interacting with people and communicating with them, and it is worth noting that there are currently no practical applications for this type of artificial intelligence.</li>
  <li><b>Self-awareness:</b>The type of self-awareness is one of the future expectations that artificial intelligence aspires to, so that machines have self-awareness and special feelings, which will make them smarter than the human being, and this concept still does not exist on Earth Reality.</li>
